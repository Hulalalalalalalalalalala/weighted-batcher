"""Durable append-only metric log with rotation, compaction and resume.

Each metric occupies exactly one newline-terminated JSON line.  A record is
appended with :func:`os.write` against a single ``O_APPEND`` file
descriptor, so concurrent appending processes never interleave one line
with another.  Recovery acknowledges only newline-terminated lines: a
record torn by a mid-write crash survives as an unterminated tail and is
silently discarded.

:func:`rotate_metrics` seals the current log into a numbered segment
(``path.1``, ``path.2``, ...) and leaves an empty log behind.  Segment
numbers are one past the highest number ever used, so deleting a segment
from the outside never makes its number come back.  Recovery walks the
segments in ascending order followed by the current log, so a record
accepted before a rotation never crosses a segment boundary.
:func:`iter_metrics` performs the same walk as a line-by-line generator,
never loading the segment set into memory.

:func:`compact_metrics` merges every segment and the current log into the
single fixed segment ``path.1`` and leaves an empty current log.  Records
are copied byte for byte, still newline terminated, without re-rendering.
The merge lands first in a staging file at ``path.compact``; only after it
is fully on disk does cleanup begin.

:func:`resume_metrics` resumes the same write-order walk at an integer
read position counting records already read from the start; the position
needs no translation across appends, rotations, compactions or crash
cleanup.
