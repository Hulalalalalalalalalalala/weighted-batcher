"""Durable append-only metric log with rotation and crash recovery.

Each metric occupies exactly one newline-terminated JSON line.  A record is
appended with :func:`os.write` against a single ``O_APPEND`` file
descriptor, so concurrent appending processes never interleave one line
with another.  Recovery acknowledges only newline-terminated lines: a
record torn by a mid-write crash survives as an unterminated tail and is
silently discarded.

:func:`rotate_metrics` seals the current log into a numbered segment
(``path.1``, ``path.2``, ...) and leaves an empty log behind.  Recovery
walks the segments in ascending order followed by the current log, so a
record accepted before a rotation never crosses a segment boundary.
:func:`iter_metrics` performs the same walk as a line-by-line generator,
never loading the segment set into memory.
