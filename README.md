# weighted-batcher

Weighted sampling helpers whose selection sequence is reproducible from a seed, plus metric rendering that keeps very large counters exact.

## Requirements

Python 3.11 or newer. Standard library only.

## Install

    python3 -m pip install -e .

## Run

    python3 -m weighted_batcher --selftest

Append one metric line to a durable log, or recover the log back as JSON:

    python3 -m weighted_batcher record FILE METRICS_JSON
    python3 -m weighted_batcher recover FILE

`recover` prints one JSON object per line on stdout and exits 0.

## Public interface

`weighted_batcher.Sampler(weights, replacement=True, seed=None)`.
- `Sampler.sample(n) -> list[int]` returns drawn indices.
- `Sampler.weights -> list[float]` as supplied.
- `weighted_batcher.render_metrics(metrics) -> str` returns one line of JSON.
- `weighted_batcher.parse_metrics(line) -> dict` accepts what `render_metrics` produced.
- `weighted_batcher.append_metrics(path, line) -> None` validates one JSON object
  line and appends it to `path`. Concurrent processes appending to the same file
  never interleave records. Raises `OSError` if `line` is not a string or the
  path is not writable, `ValueError` if the top level is not a JSON object, and
  `TypeError` if a key is not a string or a value is not an int or float
  (booleans do not count).
- `weighted_batcher.recover_metrics(path) -> list[dict]` reads the log back.
  Every complete newline-terminated line is parsed; a torn unterminated tail
  left by a crashed writer is silently discarded. A non-JSON line in the middle
  raises `ValueError` naming its line number. An empty or newline-only file
  yields `[]`. Missing files raise `FileNotFoundError`; directories raise
  `IsADirectoryError`. Large counters return as exact ints, `-0.0` is
  preserved, and key order follows the file.

## Tests

    python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t .

## Limits

The sampler is single-threaded and deterministic per seed.
Counters are integers; no floating point rounding is applied to them.
No dataset loading and no training loop.
